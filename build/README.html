<h1 id="udacityfront-endwebdevelopernanodegree-neighborhoodmapproject">Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nano Degree - Neighborhood Map Project</h1>

<p>The final project of the Neighbourhood Project, part of the Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nano Degree Course.</p>

<h2 id="thegoals:">The Goals:</h2>

<ul>
<li>make a neighbourhood map app</li>
<li>use Ajax to gather data from third party apis.</li>
<li>applying javascript design patterns (MVC, MVVM etc.) using knockout.js.</li>
<li>utilize the google maps api</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="theapp:">The app:</h2>

<ul>
<li>the chosen neighbourhood is Prenzlauerberg in Berlin, Germany</li>
<li>the page consists of

<ul>
<li>a header</li>
<li>a control bar with a search term input, a area dropdown list, a submit button</li>
<li>a page wide map that centers by default on Prenzlauerberg</li>
<li>the neighbourhood is devided into 14 areas (the data is requested from the myJson api), which are shown on the map as coloured, clickable polygons</li>
<li>a right hand, clickable list that appears after submitting a search with the results of that search</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="usage:">Usage:</h2>

<ul>
<li>the map:

<ul>
<li>a click/tap on a marker on the map animates it and opens an infowindow with limited information</li>
<li>a click/tap on one of the coloured area polygons opens an infowindow with more information and an image of the area</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the search:

<ul>
<li>fill in a search term in the input window</li>
<li>select one of the names in the dropdown list to select an area</li>
<li>click/tap the submit button</li>
<li>the click/tap on the submit button will trigger a search in the Foursquare api.</li>
<li>results of the search will be displayed in a right hand pop up results list and on the map by clickable icons</li>
<li>when an item in the results list is clicked the corresponding icon on the map will bounce and an infowindow with Foursquare data will open</li>
<li>if there is a url available of one of the results there is a clickable link which opens the third party website in a new tab.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="responsive:">Responsive:</h2>

<ul>
<li>the app is responsive and can be used on all devices</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="howitworks:">How it works:</h2>

<ul>
<li>calling the map api:

<ul>
<li>the map api is called with a callback to the getAreas function</li>
<li>if the map api cannot be reached an error message is displayed (if it&#8217;s only the key that isn&#8217;t correct the default google maps error message is displayed)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>getAreas:

<ul>
<li>the getAreas function requests the model data from myJson (myjson.com)</li>
<li>and sends it to the viewmodel (appViewModel) and to the map (initMap)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the viewModel:

<ul>
<li>appViewModel handles the visible parts and stores all variables that are generated by the user&#8217;s actions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>on submit:

<ul>
<li>the submit function uses the info from the appViewModel to call the foursquare api</li>
<li>the submit function then processes the data that is send back (put it in the fsqrData array, handle undefined results)</li>
<li>it sends a message to the view if there aren&#8217;t any results</li>
<li>it warns by means of a red text in the right hand list if foursquare throws an error</li>
<li>it sends data to the viewmodel to set the result list, which is displayed in the right hand pop up list</li>
</ul></li>
<li>initMap:

<ul>
<li>initMap sets the initial map with the data it gets from getAreas (myJson), including markers and polygons and their click event listeners</li>
<li>initMap responds through submit to the user and foursquare generated data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>initMap after submit:

<ul>
<li>and displays only the chosen area by way of its marker (bounces) and the polygon (stands out)</li>
<li>other markers are filtered out and other polygon have their opacity adjusted</li>
<li>foursquare icons corresponding to the data in the results list are placed on the map</li>
<li>click events are attached to the icons to open infowindows with foursquare data when clicked</li>
<li>dom click event listeners are attached to the results list which animate the corresponding icons and open the same foursquare infowindows</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
