# Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nano Degree - Neighborhood Map Project
The final project of the Neighbourhood Project, part of the Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nano Degree Course.

## The Goals:
- make a neighbourhood map app
- use Ajax to gather data from third party apis.
- applying javascript design patterns (MVC, MVVM etc.) using knockout.js.
- utilize the google maps api

## The app:
- the chosen neighbourhood is Prenzlauerberg in Berlin, Germany
- the page consists of 
	- a header
	- a control bar with a search term input, a area dropdown list, a submit button
	- a page wide map that centers by default on Prenzlauerberg
	- the neighbourhood is devided into 14 areas (the data is requested from the myJson api), which are shown on the map as coloured, clickable polygons
	- a right hand, clickable list that appears after submitting a search with the results of that search
	
## Usage:
- the map:
	- a click/tap on a marker on the map animates it and opens an infowindow with limited information 
	- a click/tap on one of the coloured area polygons opens an infowindow with more information and an image of the area
- the search:
	- fill in a search term in the input window
	- select one of the names in the dropdown list to select an area
	- click/tap the submit button
	- the click/tap on the submit button will trigger a search in the Foursquare api.
	- results of the search will be displayed in a right hand pop up results list and on the map by clickable icons
	- when an item in the results list is clicked the corresponding icon on the map will bounce and an infowindow with Foursquare data will open
	- if there is a url available of one of the results there is a clickable link which opens the third party website in a new tab. 

## Responsive:
- the app is responsive and can be used on all devices

## How it works:
- calling the map api:
	- the map api is called with a callback to the getAreas function
	- if the map api cannot be reached an error message is displayed (if it's only the key that isn't correct the default google maps error message is displayed)
- getAreas:
	- the getAreas function requests the model data from myJson (myjson.com)
	- and sends it to the viewmodel (appViewModel) and to the map (initMap)
- the viewModel:
	- appViewModel handles the visible parts and stores all variables that are generated by the user's actions
- on submit:
	- the submit function uses the info from the appViewModel to call the foursquare api
	- the submit function then processes the data that is send back (put it in the fsqrData array, handle undefined results)
	- it sends a message to the view if there aren't any results
	- it warns by means of a red text in the right hand list if foursquare throws an error
	- it sends data to the viewmodel to set the result list, which is displayed in the right hand pop up list
- initMap:
	- initMap sets the initial map with the data it gets from getAreas (myJson), including markers and polygons and their click event listeners 
	- initMap responds through submit to the user and foursquare generated data 
- initMap after submit:
	- and displays only the chosen area by way of its marker (bounces) and the polygon (stands out)
	- other markers are filtered out and other polygon have their opacity adjusted
	- foursquare icons corresponding to the data in the results list are placed on the map
	- click events are attached to the icons to open infowindows with foursquare data when clicked
	- dom click event listeners are attached to the results list which animate the corresponding icons and open the same foursquare infowindows
